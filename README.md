# 🎵 Music Genre Classification — Model Comparison

A comprehensive evaluation of machine‑learning models on the FMA dataset

## 🎶 Overview
This team‑developed project demonstrates music‑genre classification using the Free Music Archive (FMA) dataset. The notebook compares multiple machine‑learning and deep‑learning models to determine which approach performs best for predicting music genres from audio features and tracks metadata.

The goal is to provide a clear, reproducible workflow for preprocessing audio data and metadata, training models, and evaluating performance across different architectures.

## 🎶 Methods & Models

The notebook compares several models, Classical ML Models:

- Random Forest

- XGBoost

- CatBoost

- HDBSCAN

- K-means Clustring

- Multistage Clustring

Deep Learning Models:

- Forward Feed Neural Network (FNN)

Each model is evaluated using the same feature set to ensure a fair comparison.

## 🎶 How to Run the Notebook
1. Open the notebook in Google Colab
2. Run cells or view output cells

## 🎶 Results Summary
The notebook provides:

- A side‑by‑side comparison of all machine learning models

- Visualizations of training performance

- Insights into which models generalize best

## 🎶 Future Work
A room for improvements include:

- Using raw audio with spectrogram‑based CNNs

## 🎶 Contributions

This project was built through the combined efforts of our team as each member contributed to various aspects. My work consisted of the parts:
- EDA
- Data preprocessing for each model and its requirements
- FNN Model building and hyperparameter tunning

## 🎶 Context
This project was built as a team assighnment for [Machine Learnin Course/Artificial Intelligence at Taibah University].
